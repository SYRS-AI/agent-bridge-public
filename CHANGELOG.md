# Changelog

All notable changes to Agent Bridge are documented here. This project adheres
loosely to [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and tracks
version bumps via the `VERSION` file.

## [0.6.7] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- `memory-daily-<agent>` per-agent cron, autoregistered by
  `bootstrap-memory-system.sh` for every active Claude agent whose refresh
  gate is on. Schedule `0 3 * * *` (Asia/Seoul). Disabling the gate on a
  subsequent `--apply` deletes the stale cron.
- `bridge-memory.py harvest-daily` subcommand — detection-only reconcile
  kicker with manifest schema v1, state machine
  (`checked / queued / resolved / skipped-permission / disabled / escalated`),
  semantic-empty parser, source-confidence tiering (strong / medium / weak),
  legacy-path probe, `(agent, date)` dedupe, 24h cooldown, and
  attempts>3 escalation. Aggregate state
  (`state/memory-daily/admin-aggregate-skip.json`,
  `admin-aggregate-escalated.json`) merged with `fcntl.flock`. New
  `--skipped-permission` / `--os-user` flags wire the
  skipped-permission branch (minimal manifest + permission aggregate
  merge), and `--transcripts-home` overrides the base for
  `~/.claude/projects` scanning (used by the stub's sudo wrap and by
  smoke fixtures).
- `scripts/memory-daily-harvest.sh` — cron payload stub. Parses
  `agent show --json` so workdir / profile-home / isolation.mode /
  isolation.os_user each survive whitespace-bearing paths (per-field
  python3 parse). Derives the sidecar path from `CRON_REQUEST_DIR`
  (runner-exported) with a fallback under
  `state/memory-daily/<agent>/adhoc.authoritative.json` for manual
  invocation. Under `linux-user` isolation with a user mismatch, the
  stub forwards `--skipped-permission --os-user <user>` so the Python
  harvester writes `state=skipped-permission` and merges `(agent, date)`
  into `admin-aggregate-skip.json`. (A sudo re-exec is deliberately not
  used: the isolated UID cannot write the controller-owned cron/state
  trees until `bridge_linux_prepare_agent_isolation` grants those paths
  — tracked separately.)
- Runner-level authoritative sidecar enforcement for the `memory-daily`
  family in `bridge-cron-runner.py`. Sidecar is the preferred source in the
  normal path and in the parse-exception recovery path, with
  `child_result_source` and `sidecar_error_note` audit fields in
  `result.json`.
- Daemon refresh gating in `bridge-daemon.sh` — `session_refresh_queued` is
  emitted only when `actions_taken` contains `queue-backfill`; otherwise
  `session_refresh_skipped` is emitted with
  `reason=no_queue_backfill_action`. `process_memory_daily_refresh_requests`
  clears stuck pending refresh state ahead of the disabled-gate skip
  (`session_refresh_pending_cleared`, `reason=gate_off`).
- `lib/bridge-cron.sh::bridge_cron_actions_taken_contains` helper.
- Docs: `docs/agent-runtime/memory-daily-harvest.md`.
- Smoke: `tests/memory-daily-harvest/smoke.sh` covering scenarios 2, 4, 8,
  9 (skipped-permission writes manifest + aggregate), 10, residual-risk
  sidecar recovery (11), stub isolation-mismatch dispatch (12), and
  stub default-path dispatch (13).

### Changed
- `bridge-cron-runner.py`: `run_codex` and `run_claude` signatures accept an
  optional `request_file` so the runner can export `CRON_REQUEST_DIR` to the
  child process environment.
- `bridge-daemon.sh` cron worker completion path now gates the memory-daily
  session-refresh on `actions_taken`.

### Notes
- Canonical `users/default/memory` path alignment is tracked separately. This
  release probes the legacy path read-only to suppress false-positive
  backfills.
- Session `/wrap-up` remains the primary daily-note writer and is out of
  scope here.

Fixes #216
